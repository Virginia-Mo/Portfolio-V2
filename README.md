**Hey There !**

This is the second version of my portfolio. I wanted to make something interactive and fun so I got the idea to make a "RPG Like" game.
The visitor can walk in the -small- map and discover  different parts of my portfolio through boards in the houses.

To make this project, I bought some tilesets (copyrights are in the scenes2 folder) and created a template of what I wanted my map to look like with the software "Tiled".  
Then, I coded everything using the library KaboomJS and Javascript.
The map was coded using many "levels" with different tiles, and the different interactions made with Kaboom methods.
